# 2.5-month-of-nutanix-hybrid-cloud-challenge
This repo contains all the information related to Nutanix® Hybrid Cloud Scholarship Program of Phase-I and if selected then of Phase-II as well.


Today, I am able to complete this challenge which takes almost 35 days of dedicated hard work. I personally feel the course content was easy for every one to grasp and learn fast. 
In the whole process, I have learned: \

- How technology evolved over the years to bring us to the hybrid cloud of today.
- Got familiar with the basics of hybrid cloud networking, security, virtual machine management, and data protection.
- Became a little more comfortable with hyperconverged infrastructure and the hybrid cloud itself.

Thanks to Everyone\

Next I will help other to solve their query.

## Day 33: July 26, 2020. #30DaysofUdacity
- My current progress is:\
  **2. Modern Private Cloud Infrastructure** (Progress 98%)
    - **Lesson 7. Data Protection** (Progress 78%)
		- **Lesson Overview**
			- The state of data protection
			- The complexities of data protection in a hybrid cloud world
			- Data protection trends
			- Data protection in the hybrid cloud
		- **The Cost of a Disaster**
		- **Data Protection Challenges**
		- **Data Protection Trends**
			- **Application-centric protection**
			- **Automation**
			- **Copy data management**
		- **RTO and RPO**
			- **Recovery Time Objective** refers to the time allowed to restore normal operations when an IT failure or disruption occurs, in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity. An RTO of one hour means an application or a data-set will be back online within one hour after a failure occurs.\
			- **Recovery Point Object refers** to the quantity of data that a business can lose, before the amount of data lost during that period, exceeds a maximum allowable threshold which would result in unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity.
		- **Data Protection in the Hybrid Cloud**
		- **Infrastructure Resilience**
			- **Infrastructure Resilience: Tunable Redundancy**\
				**Tunable redundancy**, replaces traditional, hardware-centric RAID. Each Nutanix data container, which is the equivalent of a VM datastore, has a data Replication Factor, or “RF”, of 2 or 3. This means that either two or three copies of data are maintained at all times.
			![infrastruture-resilience:-tunable-redundancy](images/infrastruture-resilience:-tunable-redundancy.png)
			- **Infrastructure Resilience: Erasure Coding**\
				**Erasure Coding** encodes a strip of data blocks that reside on different nodes in the cluster, and calculates parity using software, instead of physical disk controllers. 
			![infrastructureresilience:-erasure-coding](images/infrastructureresilience:-erasure-coding.png)
			- **Infrastructure Resilience: Integrity Checks**
			- **Infrastructure Resilience: Availability Domains**
				- **Node Awareness:** Exactly how a cluster survives node failures without losing access to its data.
				- **Block Awareness:** Block awareness takes node awareness a step further, by distributing data replicas across multiple blocks. A block, incidentally, is a multi-node enclosure that can contain up to four nodes. In the case of block awareness, if a block fails, there is always at least one replica of all data on the node of another block.
				- **Rack Awareness:** Rack awareness builds on block awareness in the same way, and provides data availability in case of a rack-level failure, for instance a power outage.

## Day 32: July 25, 2020. #30DaysofUdacity
- My current progress is:\
  **2. Modern Private Cloud Infrastructure** (Progress 92%)
    - **Lesson 6. Managing Virtual Machines in the Hybrid Cloud** (Progress 100%)
		- **Exercise: Uploading Images to the Image Service**
		- **Creating a VM**

		- **Updating/Modifying a VM**
		- **Exercise: Updating CPU and Memory on a VM**
		- **Cloning a VM**
		- **Deleting a VM**
		- **Migrating a VM** 
		- **What is VM High Availability?**\
			High availability refers to the ability of a system to run continuously without failure. This doesn’t mean that the system or components of it cannot fail; It just means that the system is designed to account for and compensate for failures when they happen. And, since VMs represent the interface with which end users interact with a virtualized system, being able to provide high uptime and strong tolerance for failure is especially important.

    - **Lesson 2. Journey to the Modern Cloud** (Progress 78%)
		- **Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI)**
			Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) converges the entire datacenter stack, including compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. Some key points to remember about HCI are:

				- Software running on each server node distributes all operating functions across a cluster. This allows incremental scaling, so that a cluster can be grown one node at a time; performance increases as the environment grows.
				- The software also creates clusters and pools local storage, eliminating the need for SAN or NAS infrastructure​.
				- The removal of the physical storage fully unleashes the power of the SDDC.
				- The use of solid state drives (SSDs), combined with data locality, provides excellent cluster performance without bottlenecks.

    2. The different models to support various Cloud initiatives
    3. The Engineer’s role in Service Level Agreements related to Cloud apps
	4. How to choose the optimal Cloud platform for an app, based on business requirements and SLAs

    - **Lesson 2. Journey to the Modern Cloud** (Progress 15%)
		- **Why are Hybrid Cloud Engineers needed?**
		- **What does a Hybrid Cloud Engineer do?**
			A hybrid cloud engineer can design, create, operate, and manage different types of workloads across multiple clouds and infrastructure providers.
		- **Digital Transformation**
			The need for complex and specialized silos for data center infrastructure was removed by public cloud providers through the commoditization of the IT industry. This is called digital transformation (or DX) in the industry and refers to traditional IT practices making the effort necessary to modernize. Naturally, this takes a lot of time and resources.
