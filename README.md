- My current progress is:\
  **Part 1. Welcome to the Nutanix Hybrid Cloud Foundation Course** (Progress 100%)\
    I have gathered idea about this program and joined slack community to learn and collaborate together.
    ### Welcome and Congratulations!
     Udacity and Nutanix are excited to welcome you to the Nutanix Hybrid Cloud Scholarship Phase 1 (Modern Private Cloud Infrastructure). Here are some helpful   details as you start the program.

    ### How the Scholarship Foundation works:
     The lessons in this Foundation course have been specially designed to prepare you to take the full Hybrid Cloud Nanodegree program. We recommend you take the time to go through the carefully prepared lessons, as course completion is required to qualify for a Nanodegree scholarship. If you have questions, we encourage you to ask directly in our student community.
